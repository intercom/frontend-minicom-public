# Minicom Test application

This is a test application that uses the same dependencies as the interview project. It is used to test the dependencies and make sure they are working correctly ahead of your interview.

## What do I have to do?

Follow the setup instructions below and make sure the application is running correctly.

If it is, you should be able to access it at `http://localhost:5173`.

And you should see a message that says "Congratulations, you are all set for your interview" in the center of the page.

ðŸ¥³ If those worked, well done! You're all set for the interview!

ðŸ¤” **If you can't get it working, please let us know ahead of the interview ASAP.** We want to make sure you have it all set up before the interview day.

## Technology Stack

- **React 19** - UI library
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **ESLint** - Code linting and formatting
- **CSS3** - Styling

This setup provides Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for fast development and includes ESLint rules for code quality.

# Troubleshooting

- Errors running the local dev server are often because of incompatible node versions. Check your node version and ensure you are on at least version 24. 
- This project was last tested with node version 24.18.0 and npm version 10.2.0.
